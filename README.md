## 💡 Philosophy & Approach

> *"From Agent Smith 🕶️ to Legal Agent 🤓"*

I went from watching *The Matrix* as a kid to building **AI Agents** in the real world. Today I develop autonomous agents that:

1. **Make decisions** based on legal logic
2. **Execute actions** (deploy contracts, audit risks)
3. **Learn from business context**

The technology that seemed like science fiction is now a **necessity** to democratize legal services in Colombia.
